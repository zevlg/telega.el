;; ** /telega-live-location.el/ -- Manage live location in Telega using geo.el
;;
;; Enable this mode with {{{kbd(M-x global-telega-live-location-mode RET)}}}
;;
;; This mode installs new ~live-geo-location~ chat attach type, use it
;; with {{{kbd(C-c C-a live-geo-location RET)}}} in the chatbuf.
;; 
;; This mode requires the =geo.el= library, available at
;; https://git.sr.ht/~oldosfan/geo-xdg.el
;; 
;; Take into account that using ~geo-simulate~ backend to fake geo
;; location data is Telegram API ToS violation.  See 1.4 in
;; https://core.telegram.org/api/terms
