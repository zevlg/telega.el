`telega.el` is full featured unofficial client for
[Telegram](https://telegram.org "Telegram") platform for [GNU
Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ "GNU Emacs").

`telega.el` is actively developed, for this reason, some features are
not implemented, or they are present just as skeleton for future
implementation. However, the core parts are mature enough so that it
is possible to use `telega.el` for basic chat.

# Installation

`telega.el` depends on `visual-fill-column` package.  This dependency
automatically installs if you install telega from MELPA or GNU Guix.  
Otherwise will you need to install this package by hand.

`telega.el` is built on top of the official library provided by
Telegram [TDLib 1.6.0](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib "tdlib"). Most
of the distributions do not package this libary, in which case it must
be built manually.

[GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/), however, does have both `telega.el`
and `TDLib` packaged.  If you use GNU Guix you can skip directly to
[Installing from GNU Guix](#installing-telegael-and-tdlib-from-gnu-guix).

## Dependencies

   * `GNU Emacs` (at least 26.1 is required)
   * `GNU make`
   * `GNU gperf`
   * `CMake`
   * `Python` (for testing the server)

`make` is found in most of the modern machines. The other packages can
be download with the system package manager (such as `apt` for
Debian-based distributions, `dnf` for Fedora or `pacman` for
Arch-based).

### MacOS users

1. If you are using [Emacs For Mac OS X](https://emacsformacosx.com/),
   or you installed Emacs by running `brew cask install emacs`, your
   Emacs lacks svg support, so you cannot use telega. Please switch to
   [emacs-plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus).

2. If you are using
   [Emacs-mac](https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/), or you
   installed Emacs by running `brew install emacs-mac` or `brew cask
   install emacs-mac`, your Emacs has bug dealing with complex svg,
   which leads to Emacs hangups.  Compiling Emacs with rsvg support by running
   `brew install emacs-mac --with-rsvg` will fix this problem.

   NOTE: Telega cannot display stickers correctly with emacs-mac, even when 
   emacs-mac is compiled with rsvg support.  If you want sticker support, please 
   consider switching to emacs-plus.

3. [emacs-plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) is
   the best choice to run telega.

### Linux users

`telega.el` requires at least GNU Emacs 26.1 with `imagemagick` and
`svg` support. Most distributions provide GNU Emacs compiled with these
dependencies when installing GNU Emacs with GTK+ support (graphical).

### Building tdlib

[TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib "tdlib") is the library for
building Telegram clients. It requires a large amount of memory to be
built.  Make sure you are using TDLib version 1.6.0.

On MacOS you can install a pre-built `tdlib` package using homebrew from
[brew.sh](https://brew.sh).  Just run:
```console
$ brew install tdlib
```

On Linux, you will need to build `tdlib` from source.

To get the source:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/tdlib/td.git
```

Move into the folder with `cd ./td` or wherever you
checked out `td`.

Prepare a folder for building the library:
```console
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../
```

Build the sources:
```console
$ make -jN
```

with `N` number of cores that should be used for the compilation (the optimal
value is the number of physical cores on the machine).

Finally, to install the library system-wide:
```console
$ sudo make install
```

It will install headers to `/usr/local/include` and library itself
into `/usr/local/lib`.  These paths are hardcoded in `telega.el`.

### Building libtgvoip

VoIP support in `telega.el` is optional, if you don't need VoIP, just
ignore this section.

[libtgvoip](https://github.com/zevlg/libtgvoip "libtgvoip") is the
VoIP library for telegram clients.  This is the fork from
[original](https://github.com/grishka/libtgvoip) library with patches
needed by `telega.el`.

To get the source:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/zevlg/libtgvoip.git
```

Move into the folder with `cd ./libtgvoip` or wherever
you checked out `libtgvoip`.

Prepare a folder for building the library:
```console
$ autoreconf --force --install && ./configure && make
```

Install the library system-wide:
```console
$ sudo make install
```

It will also install headers to `/usr/local/include` and library into
`/usr/local/lib`.

## Installing telega.el from MELPA

`telega.el` is available from [MELPA](https://melpa.org), so you can install
it from there as usual package.  This is a preferable method, because it
will automatically handle all dependencies.  After installing `telega.el` from 
MELPA you can skip to [Fire up `telega.el`](#fire-up-telegael) section.

Or you could use git repository with this melpa-style recipe:

```lisp
(:fetcher github
 :repo "zevlg/telega.el"
 :branch "master"
 :files (:defaults "etc" "server" "Makefile"))
```

## Building telega-server

Now that the `TDLib` library is set-up, it is time to install
`telega.el`. The first step consists in building `telega-server`,
which is a C interface to the `TDLib`, or just let `telega` ask you at
the first start and do the job (dependencies for compilation will need
to be installed ahead-of-time).

To get the source:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el
```

Moving into the folder with `cd telega.el`, it is possible to build
the `telega-server` executable and move into the `$HOME/.telega` with:
```console
$ make && make install && make test
```

If you want VoIP support in `telega.el` and `libtgvoip` is installed,
then use this instead:
```console
$ make WITH_VOIP=t && make WITH_VOIP=t install && make WITH_VOIP=t test
```

This command does not require superuser privileges.

Start with `M-x telega RET` and follow instructions

## Installing telega.el

Now it is time to install `telega.el` on GNU Emacs.

This can be done with `use-package`:

```elisp
(use-package telega
  :load-path  "~/telega.el"
  :commands (telega)
  :defer t)
```

Or with:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/telega.el")
(require 'telega)
```

The code should be put in the configuration file for Emacs, which
usually is `init.el`, or `emacs.el`.

## Installing telega.el and tdlib from [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/)

`telega.el` and `tdlib` are both available in GNU Guix. If you have a resource
constrained machine or would simply prefer to bypass compiling `tdlib` from
source, this is a good option!

On Guix System:
```console
$ guix package -i emacs-telega
```

On "Foreign" Distributions:
- Use the shell installer script, or install GNU Guix manually on-top of your
current distribution. [Installation Documentation](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Installation.html#Installation)

- Enable fetching substitutes from the build server cache if you do not
wish to build from source. [Substitute Server Authorization](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Substitute-Server-Authorization.html#Substitute-Server-Authorization)

- And finally, run:
```console
$ guix package -i emacs emacs-telega
```

You will need a version of emacs installed from GNU Guix because it is
modified with an autoloader to identify and automatically use emacs
packages installed from Guix.

Consult the official GNU Guix documentation for further questions. Issues related
to the GUIX package must be accompanied by the [GUIX label](https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el/labels/guix)
in the issue tracker.

Do note that since `telega` is actively maintained installations from Guix might
at times lag behind master, but regular attempts to keep it updated will occur.
If the version in Guix is too outdated or is missing a feature, please use the
protocol for the issue tracker.

## Fire up `telega.el`

`telega.el` can now be started with `M-x telega RET`. The first time
it will ask for the phone number you have associated with the Telegram
network. 

# Minor modes

See [Minor Modes](https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el/blob/master/doc/telega-manual.org#minor-modes) section in [telega manual](https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el/blob/master/doc/telega-manual.org).

## telega-notifications-mode

`telega.el` ships with support for D-Bus notifications, but they are
disabled by default.  To enable notifications add next code to your
`init.el`:

```elisp
(telega-notifications-mode 1)
```

# Enabling emoji completions in chat buffer

Emoji completions with `:<EMOJI-NAME>:` syntax, uses nice
[company-mode](http://company-mode.github.io).  It provides
`telega-company-emoji` company backend.  So you need to add it to
`company-backends`, maybe along with other backends in
`telega-chat-mode-hook`, for example:

```elisp
(add-hook 'telega-chat-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends)
                 (append '(telega-company-emoji
                           telega-company-username
                           telega-company-hashtag)
                         (when (telega-chat-bot-p telega-chatbuf--chat)
                           '(telega-company-botcmd))))
            (company-mode 1)))
```

# Configuring client side messages filtering

In official telegram clients all messages in group chats are displayed
even if message has been sent by blocked user.  `telega.el` has client
side message filtering feature implemented.  Ignoring messages can be
done via installing special functions into
`telega-chat-pre-message-hook` which could mark message as ignored on arrival,
for example, to ignore messages from particular user with id=12345 you
could add next code:

```elisp
(defun my-telega-ignore-12345-user (msg &rest notused)
  (when (= (plist-get msg :sender_user_id) 12345)
    (telega-msg-ignore msg)))

(add-hook 'telega-chat-pre-message-hook 'my-telega-ignore-12345-user)
```

And if you are willing to additionally ignore messages when fetching chat history,
you could add following lines:

```elisp
(advice-add 'telega-chatbuf--append-messages
             :before (lambda (messages) (mapcar #'my-telega-ignore-12345-user messages)))
(advice-add 'telega-chatbuf--prepend-messages
             :before (lambda (messages) (mapcar #'my-telega-ignore-12345-user messages)))
```

Or to ignore messages from blocked users, just add:

```elisp
(add-hook 'telega-chat-pre-message-hook 'telega-msg-ignore-blocked-sender)
```

To view recent messages that has been ignored use
`M-x telega-ignored-messages RET` command.

# FAQ

**Q**: I have this error after `M-x telega RET`

```console

Status: telega-server: exited abnormally with code 127
/home/user/.telega/telega-server: error while loading shared libraries:
libtdjson.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

**A**: Add `/usr/local/lib` into library loading path using next:

```console
# echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usr_local_lib.conf
# ldconfig
```

**Q**: I have this error while installing telega

```console
Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, visual-fill-column
```

**A**: `telega.el` depends on `visual-fill-column` package, please
install it first.  This package is available from
[MELPA](https://melpa.org)

**Q**: I have this error while running telega

```elisp
(error "Invalid image type ‘svg’")
```

and/or

```elisp
(error "Invalid image type ‘imagemagick’")
```

**A**: `telega.el` requires Emacs with SVG and ImageMagick support.
SVG support in Emacs is done using `librsvg` library.  As to
imagemagick, you will need `libmagickcore-dev` and `libmagickwand-dev`
packages installed.  But unfortunately Emacs recently disabled
imagemagick support by default (see
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2018-12/msg00036.html).  So you
need to compile Emacs by hand, specifying `--with-imagemagick` flag to
`./configure` script.

Telega won't depend on `imagemagick` in future, since required image
features has been added to newer Emacs, see
https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2019-06/msg00242.html

**Q**: Does telega have proxy support?

**A**: Yes, use `telega-proxies` custom variable, for example:

```elisp
(setq telega-proxies
      (list
       '(:server "1.2.3.4" :port 8080 :enable :false
                 :type (:@type "proxyTypeSocks5"
                               :username "rkn" :password "jopa"))
       '(:server "2.3.4.5" :port 8088 :enable t
                 :type (:@type "proxyTypeSocks5"
                               :username "rkn" :password "jopa"))
       ))
```
See `C-h v telega-proxies RET` for full range of proxy types.

**Q**: Stickers are not shown.

**A**: Make sure you have `imagemagick` support and please install `webp` package

**Q**: `telega.el` is unbearable slow.

**A**: You might be hitting into Emacs bug, described here https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2020-01/msg00548.html

Also see https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el/issues/161

**Q**: There are no glyphs for some unicode characters.

**A**: Please install `fonts-symbola` package

**Q**: There is some formatting issues when some unicode characters are used.

**A**: Yes, partly.  If character has full width of multiple ordinary chars you can tweak `char-width-table`.  Add code like this to your init.el:

```elisp
(setq telega-symbol-unread "🄌")

(defun my-telega-load ()
  ;; 🄌 occupies two full chars, but (string-width "🄌") returns 1
  ;; so we install custom widths to `char-width-table'
  (telega-symbol-set-width telega-symbol-unread 2)

  ;; ... other code
  )

(add-hook 'telega-load-hook 'my-telega-load)
```

There is also `telega-symbol-widths` custom variable, you might want
to modify it.

**Q**: Is there erc-like chats tracking functionality?

**A**: Yes, set `telega-use-tracking` to non-nil.

Take into account that telega tracks only opened chats with enabled
notifications.

**Q**: Is it possible to use telega in tty-only Emacs (aka
emacs-nox)?

**A**: Yes, set `telega-use-images` to `nil`, before start.

**Q**: Is it possible to use markup in outgoing messages?

**A**: Yes, use `C-u RET` to send message with markup, also see
`telega-chat-use-markdown-version`.  Supported markup:

    1. *bold text*
    2. _italic text_
    2.1) __underline text__    (only for v2)
    2.2) ~strike through text~ (only for v2)
    3. `inlined code`
    4. ```<language-name-not-displayed>
       first line of multiline preformatted code
       second line
       last line```
    5. [link text](http://actual.url)
    6. [username](tg://user?id=<USER-ID>)"
