** DONE Emacs Stories
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Вс 00:01]
CREATED: [2020-12-22 Вт]

Emacs Stories: share your Emacs experience with other Emacs users.

*** TODO show content loading progress

Maybe as gray (background color) dot becoming black (foreground color)
at the left-bottom corner

*** TODO open message thread on SPC

Now impossible because ~interaction_info~ is not updates for story
messages lists.

See possible screenshot: https://t.me/emacs_telega/22934

Use https://t.me/emacs_stories group to fetch stories, here is
rules for the stories.

Forward to @emacs_stories a message from public group, containing
Emacs Story

Messages considered as Emacs Story:
1. Nice Emacs screenshot
2. Video Message with screencast not longer then 60 seconds
3. Link to asciinema.org cast
4. Document (File) message with attached asciinema cast

All messages are moderated before appearing in Emacs Featured Stories
list

- See https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/959
- DONE initially, accounts can be switched with
  ~M-x telega-account-switch RET~.  Done by specifying different
  database directories for different accounts using
  ~telega-accounts~ custom variable.

**WON'T DO THESE**
- Personal rootbuf per account
- Make all vars used by telega buffer-local in corresponding rootbuf
- Account and "engine" saved in rootbuf
- All calls/callbacks to have "engine" param, explicitly or
  implicitly (from rootbuf's "engine")
- Set "engine" on every chat/msg/user to be implicitly used in TDLib calls
- How chatbuf should be shown per account?
- How notifications should be shown per account?
  Maybe "--> <ACCOUNT>" as in official clients?

** DONE AppIndicator in telega-server

CLOSED: [2020-02-12 Ср 18:02]

** DONE Chat sorting
CLOSED: [2020-02-01 Сб 12:13]

By default chats are ordered by date of the last message in chat.

But =telega= might sort chats by some other criteria.  Criteria might be:
- Title of the chat in alphabetical order (thanks to https://t.me/Kurvivor)
- Number of unread messages
- (WON'T DO) Number of mentions
- Number of chat members
- Number of online chat members
- Chat join date
- (NOT YET) Date of last message sent by ~telega-user-me~
- (NOT YET) Date of last mention (thanks to https://t.me/lainposter)

** DONE Transient commands
CLOSED: [2021-02-09 Вт 20:16]

Use =transient.el= package for some commands, such as ~C-c C-a~.

This adds additional dependency - =transient= package.

Make use of transient commands optional, retaining default
behaviour.

**Q**: Do we really need this?

**DONE** by contrib/telega-transient.el

** DONE Chat Actions

** DONE Support for ~getRecentInlineBots~
CLOSED: [2022-01-02 Вс 14:24]

* DONE telega-server as a module
CLOSED: [2022-01-13 Чт 22:45]

Implement telega-server as Emacs module to improve overall performance.

- Engine abstration to distinguish TDLib/TON/VoIP clients.
- Save "engine" value inside rootbuf
- "engine" as telega-server and telega-server as "engine"

**Q**: What are the benefits from having =telega-server= as module
instead of process?

*NOTE* Won't do.  Still will require us to fully support
 =telega-server= as external tool.

* DONE TON
  CLOSED: [2020-10-07 Ср 17:42]

Unfortunately TON is postponed, see https://t.me/durov/116

** DONE tonlib integration
CLOSED: [2020-01-20 Пн 14:24]
VERSION: 0.5.8
*WONT't DO*
** DONE Wallet, with list of transactions, etc (see [[https://t.me/designers/134]])
CLOSED: [2020-10-07 Ср 17:42]

- tgvoip (as submodule for =telega=?):
  https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/tgcalls

** Collaborative editor based on Voice Chats

- *Q*: How to attach supplementary info to the voice chat (file we
  are editing right now) ?
- Use CRDT for editing commands:
  https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el
- Encode CRDT commands as dubstep:
  https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/encoding-data-into-dubstep-drops
- UI ideas, see https://replit.com

* Random Ideas

Random list of ideas for telega.el

** Video content automatic viewer
Automatically goto next video message, when previous video finishes.

- Make ~telega-msg-open-content~ to return process if external process
  is spawned to show message's content.

- Do logic as it is done for vvnote messages.

** Generate SVG for chat themes
- 4 corner gradients using 4 radial gradients, see
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11072830/svg-transparency-with-multiple-gradients

[[file:~/github/telega.el/telega-chat.el::;; TODO: generate and insert SVG reflecting color values in the][Implement here in the telega-chat.el]]

** Saving chatbuf into file

Save chatbuf into the file, that can be openned afterwards.  Save as
plist like:

#+begin_example
(:files (list-of-aux-files-to-use-such-as-thumbnails)
 :avatars (list-of-avatars)
 :aux-messages (list-of-aux-messages-such-as-reply-to)
 :messages (list-of-messages-follows))
#+end_example

Better to export chatbuf messages into =org-mode= format.  Exported
directory hier example:
#+begin_example
chat_title_export_dir_from_date_to_date/
├── index.org
│     Org Mode file with chatbuf messages
├── pic1.jpg
├── pic2.jpg
       ....
#+end_example

** DONE Grouping chats by custom label, similar to ~gnus-topic.el~
CLOSED: [2020-10-07 Ср 17:42]
#+begin_example
*OOS*
  [chat1      ]
  [chat2      ]
*Emacs*
  [chat1      ]
  [chat2      ]
#+end_example

**WON'T DO**  See [[Root Views, different views for the rootbuf]]

Also: custom labels are deprecated in favor for Chat Folders

** Global searchable history of the inputs you've sent to any chat

** DONE Filters for chat messages
CLOSED: [2020-12-22 Вт 17:06]

DONE by implementing ~C-c /~ command in chatbuf.

- [X] Scheduled messages
  #+begin_example
  MSG1
  MSG2
  ______________________________________[scheduled]__
  Filter: scheduled
  >>> []
  #+end_example

- [ ] Message thread as in https://t.me/designers/44
  #+begin_example
  MSG1
  MSG2
  ________________________________________[related]__
  [x] Filter: related
  >>> []
  #+end_example

  WON'T DO? see https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/960

- [X] Shared Media
  #+begin_example
  MSG1
  MSG2
  _________________________________________[photos]__
  [x] Filter: photos
  >>> []
  #+end_example

- [X] Searching in chat
  #+begin_example
  MSG1
  MSG2
  _________________________________[search "hello"]__
  [x] Filter: searching for "hello"
  >>> []
  #+end_example

** DONE Client Side filtering for advert messages in channels
CLOSED: [2021-06-17 Чт 00:30]

Mark message with ~telega-msg-ignore~ if it contains keyboard button
with some link such as t.me/joinchat/xxx.  Much like this message is
advert

Write something like AdBlock for messages using client side
filtering. TODO so, write messages matching functionality like chat
filters.

**DONE**: by [[file:../contrib/telega-adblock.el]]

** DONE Do not show input prompt for chats you can't write into
CLOSED: [2021-11-05 Пт 10:47]

see https://t.me/emacs_telega/3775

**DONE**: prompt is shown shadowed, see https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el/commit/2a82a0a4c96b70034e9e92f9139e892afad90f43

** Annotations for chats/users

Sometimes it is very useful to have some notes about user or chat.  We
can specially mark users with annotations, so you can see you have
some notes about given person.

Store this annotation in chat's ~:client_data~

** DONE Animated text messages
CLOSED: [2020-10-07 Ср 17:24]

Text message incrementally appears.  This uses simple timer and just
updates message content by adding chars one after another.  So it
looks like you are typing this message.

**DANGEROUS** might cause account blocks, WON'T PUBLISH the code

** DONE Favorite Messages
CLOSED: [2021-02-08 Пн 05:22]

Ability to mark some message as favorite.  Emphasize favorite message
with some symbol like ★ (see [[https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el/issues/139][telega#139]])

We create special message in "Saved Message" and keep list of links to
the all favorite messages.  ~ID~ of this message we store in custom
telegram option, such as ~X-favorites-msg-id~

NOTE: Option won't work, because custom options are cleared after
logout.  Might have ~#favorite-messages~ tag as first line of the
message with list of links to favorite messages

Above approach is bad. WHY?

To mark message as favorite, just post internal telega link to the
message into "Saved Messages" with ~#favorite~ hashtag at the end.
Then simple ~searchChatMessages~ for ~#favorite~ hashtag.

However this approach will make listing favorite messages more
complex.  And making functionality such as outlining message as
favorite much much more complex.  So maybe former approach is not so
bad.

**DONE** by storing favorite messages ids in the chat's uaprops.

** Mark all chatbuf as readonly, keeping input area as ~inhibit-read-only~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
`(let ((inhibit-point-motion-hooks t))
    (with-silent-modifications
      ..
      ))
#+end_src

- But see docs for ~with-silent-modifications~

** Only changes in chatbuf input goes to undo list, making undo/redo commands usable

** Heavy background jobs

When focus switches off the Emacs and Emacs goes to idle we can
execute heavy tasks, such as fetching installed stickersets.

** DONE Mode to track switch-in chats and move cursor to corresponding chat in rootbuf
CLOSED: [2020-02-13 Чт 21:39]

Done by ~track~ value for ~telega-root-keep-cursor~.

So if side-by-side window setup used, then switching chats reflects in
the rootbuf.

Side-by-side window setup:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq telega-chat--display-buffer-action
      '((display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-use-some-window)))
(setq telega-inserter-for-chat-button 'telega-ins--chat-full-2lines)

(setq telega-chat-button-width 15)
(setq telega-root-fill-column (+ 7 telega-chat-button-width))
#+end_src

This should be executed *before* loading telega, because changing
~telega-inserter-for-chat-button~ in runtime won't have any effect.

** DONE Messages squashing mode ~telega-squash-message-mode~ 
CLOSED: [2020-02-01 Сб 23:00]

If last message in group is sent by you, and not yet seen by any chat
participant, and you send next message within
~telega-squash-message-period~ seconds, then instead of sending new
message to chat, last message is edited (adding new text to the end of
the message).

Works only for messages of ~messageText~.

** DONE Forwarding as link to message
CLOSED: [2021-03-10 Ср 11:55]

Have custom option ~telega-forward-public-message-as-link~ to
forward messages from public chats (i.e. messages having public
link) as text URL.

*WON't DO*: use {{{kbd(l)}}} to copy link to the message

** DONE Special mode to view images
CLOSED: [2020-02-14 Пт 02:30]

Mode to view images from chatbuf.

- Save chat and current image message in image-view buffer
- {{{kbd(n)}}} next image in chat
- {{{kbd(p)}}} prev image in chat

** DONE Ввести custom variable - telega-media-size
CLOSED: [2020-10-07 Ср 17:21]

'(MIN-WIDTH  MIN-HEIGHT MAX-WIDTH  MAX-HEIGHT)

И при показе любой картинки делать её, чтобы она была в пределах
этих размерах, не меньше и не больше.  Если картинка не помещается
(меньше или больше по ширине или высоте), то скейлим.  После
применения скейлинга нужно посчитать как x-margin так и y-margin
(задаётся как cons в :margin)

**NOTE**: y-margin не получилось, последний леер оказывается с
дыркой. Нужно просто при нарезке лееров в последний леер включать все
"лишние" пикселы, которые остались от деления height на размер высоту
линии.

** DONE Voice messages recognition
CLOSED: [2023-03-12 Вс 22:54]

*WON'T DO*: Use Telegram Premium feature to recognize voice/video
messages.

Use https://t.me/voicybot to recognize audio messages

Could look like:
#+begin_example
▶||...|..||. (1m:27s) [Download]
Optional caption goes here
[Recognize via @voicybot]
#+end_example

And when you press on ~[Recognize via @voicybot]~
#+begin_example
▶||...|..||. (1m:27s) [Download]
Optional caption goes here
via @voicybot: Recognized text
               goes here
#+end_example

What about setting language?

** Do not show avatar for some chats

Use ~telega-chat-show-avatars-for~ chatfilter instead of boolean
~telega-chat-show-avatars~.

** DONE RET to insert newline if point is not at the end of chatbuf input
CLOSED: [2020-12-22 Вт 15:17]

So RET in the middle of chatbuf input behaves as ~C-j~.  Make this
customizable.

See ~telega-chat-ret-always-sends-message~

** Prefetch map thumbnail zoom levels

Prefetch map zoom levels when user presses +/- for the first

** Tramp-alike files opening from Telegram cloud                  :important:

- See ~file-name-handler-alist~
- See ~url-handler-mode~

Specify it as part of interal =telega= link, like:
~/telega:@zevlg#167430~

So you could set say ~org-default-notes-file~ to point to file
stored in "Saved Messages"
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-default-notes-file "/telega:@zevlg#167430")
#+end_src

Directories could be organized as:
- text message with directory name as content and ~#dir~ tag,
  f.e.: "#dir /ideas"

- replies to this message are directory files
- If DocumentMessage - ordinary file
- If TextMessage - subdirectory

To get list of the directories use ~telega--getMessageThreadHistory~

** Live tracks for live locations

Idea is to draw tracks how user moves while with live location.
I.e. create list of point where user been, and then show them on the
map.  Create next point only if user moves more then say 100 meters.

See ~telega-location-live-tracks~

** DONE Seeking in audio messages
CLOSED: [2021-08-03 Вт 11:36]

When progress bar pressed inside, seek to the corresponding moment,
i.e. stop current player and start new one seeking to the moment.

#+begin_example
[....              ]30s
            ^
            `--- press RET here to seek
#+end_example

For video messages you can use video player's shortcuts to seek

**DONE** by providing media controls to seek/pause/stop.

** DONE Show status of currently uploading/downloading files
CLOSED: [2020-12-30 Ср 19:00]

See https://t.me/emacs_telega/23100

- *[NOT DONE]* Associate uploading/downloading file with the
  message, where uploading/downloading is associated
- Implement root view to show that messages
- Update root view on fly to see uploading/downloading progress

** DONE Add ~telega-msg-ignore-predicates~ custom var
CLOSED: [2020-12-29 Вт 18:02]

Holding list of functions accepting single argument - messages and
returning non-nil if message should be ignored.

To simplify client side messages filtering.

Predicates runs in ~telega-chat-pre-message-hook~ and
~telega-chat-insert-message-hook~

NOTE: In telega 0.8.72 ~telega-chat-insert-message-hook~ hook has been
renamed into ~telega-chatbuf-pre-msg-insert-hook~.

** DONE Make use of ~:progressive_sizes~ in photo sizes
CLOSED: [2021-08-03 Вт 11:34]

To show intermediate photo downloading progress.

** DONE Support for ~telega-autoplay-mode~ when jumping to the message
CLOSED: [2021-08-03 Вт 16:53]

Automatically play the message if ~telega-chat--goto-msg~ is used to
jump to the message.  Maybe introduce a
~telega-chat-goto-message-hook~ ?
